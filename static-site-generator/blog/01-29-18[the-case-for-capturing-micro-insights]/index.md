## Humans are wasteful

Every day, each of us wastes untold precious resources. I’m not talking about water, or clean air, I’m talking about a much more valuable commodity. I’m referencing the very thing that separates humanity from the rest of the animal kingdom — our thoughts.

### Our thoughts are powerful

Human thought created the wheel, domesticated plants and animals, developed cities, and made us the most powerful species on earth. And yet, most of our daily thoughts simply evaporate into the ether. This would be understandable in a pre-modern context where information storage was restricted to our brain’s limited capacity. Storing every thought would have been impossible. However, that is not the world we currently live in. Today we have single computers that can store over a hundred terabytes of information and networks of machines that can communicate from all around the globe. Modern technology has solved the storage problem and with the right technology, we could offload our thoughts onto these machines. 

### Half-baked ideas can still be yummy
But why even bother recording these thoughts in the first place? Aren’t most ideas half-baked at best? Yes, but a half-baked idea can be the seed of a revolutionary idea, if properly cultivated! At Hex Ventures, we call these amorphous thought jumbles: micro-insights.  A single micro-insight is not likely to be fully coherent by itself and might not offer any obvious value, but consider what might happen when you combine many micro-insights together. Where one trails off, another might pick up. A gap in one might be filled in by another. 

### A beautiful mess
The beauty of this phenomena is that it need not be restricted to the thoughts of a single individual. Imagine what could happen when you bring together the daily micro-insights generated by 10, 100, or 1000 different people. Consider what value could be derived from connecting these disparate ideas. Now envision a world where these micro-insights aren’t just coming from disconnected strangers, but are coming from a group of individuals working towards a common goal. What I’m describing is collaborative brainstorming applied to the thoughts we already have!

There are two obvious questions that arise: 

1. Ok, storage might not be an issue but how do we get our thoughts into it? How do we go about recording these micro-insights?

2. Even if we somehow managed to record them, how would we draw meaningful connections from a sea of randomness?

Leveraging intelligent technology to answer these two questions is what Hex Ventures is all about — and we certainly have some good ideas.
