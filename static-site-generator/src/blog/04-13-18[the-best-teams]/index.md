### Importance of the team

Building the right team is crucial to the success of a startup. According to CB Insights, [25% of startups fail because the team simply was not right](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/). Other factors like market demand for the product are obviously important, but uncontrollable. A founder, or co-founders in our case, on the *right* team member.

Actually, many people have written about the importance of just *having* a team at all. Paul Graham, the co-founder of Y-Combinator believes "starting a start-up is too hard for one person. Even if you could do all the work yourself, you need colleagues to brainstorm with, to talk you out of stupid decisions, and to cheer you up when things go wrong." I agree... we are social beings after all. 

So, you need a team, and the team needs to be somehow *right*.

I can't begin to provide a formula for this equation, nor do I want to. Cameron, Cole and I just started this company and haven't even told you what we are building yet (stay tuned!!!). 

What I do want to share with you, however, are a few principles Cameron and I came up with when recruiting our third co-founder, Cole McCracken. We had attempted to bring on a fourth co-founder as well but were turned down.

### Cole

This is Cole in his natural habitat. Pixelated and barely exposing a public API. He speaks in Java and is a self-described abstraction.

Successfully recruiting Cole is a big deal, a bigger deal than I think Cameron or I give credit. It is a big deal because Cole was previously a superstar at Linkedin where he was quickly climbing the ranks of engineers. He was respected, made good money, had a great work-life balance and most importantly ate amazingly. The LinkedIn cafeteria is one of the best restaurants in all of San Francisco. Unfortunately, we can no longer get a reservation there, but alas, we have Cole.

To the outside observer, Cole gives the team a few things Cam and I lack: 

1. Technical expertise in search.
2. A guy like Cole adds a bit of clout to what we are doing.
3. Lunch recommendations around our office.

Cole is an equal founding member of the team and Cameron and I wanted it that way. I will tell you why in another blog post.

###Why Him

Why didn't we go to market? Why not outsource Cole's function until we could get someone with more experience and tenure? Why not wait?

We asked ourselves these questions during the process, but through our discussions, became convinced of one primary thing:

**Understanding how someone works, their strengths, limitations, demeanor, and style are more valuable than the sum of that person's skill. Most importantly, that understanding breeds trust, the ultimate asset.**

Cole is a classmate from Princeton. Cameron and Cole worked together on countless computer science projects, burning oil far past midnight on many occasions. As the two technical founders, they know how each other works inside and out.

The three of us lived together for two school years in an infamous quad of 8. Technically, there were two neighboring rooms, but for all intents and purposes, the rooms' contents and their inhabitants were the same. This experience helped us fully understand how each other lives. I believe you do not truly know someone unless you have lived with them. I am not advocating a founder go live with their potential colleagues... but it wouldn't hurt either.

Lastly, we each understand how the other reacts to tough situations. 6 am wake-up calls for spring soccer conditioning were not fun, but built comradery and trust. 

Taking the sports analogy further, a team of good soccer players who understand and trust each other will most likely beat a team of superstars that are playing together for the first time. I have seen this play out many times in my own career.

This principle, while not the entire reason, was one of the primary forces leading to Leicester's 2016 premiership triumph. They only had two stars: Mahrez and Vardy (many would not even put them in the *superstar* category), but they trusted each other and had a chemistry and belief that catapulted them to English football lore. The stuff of legends.

So, understanding and trust are core and implementing the systems that ensure the team continues to be built on these principles will definitely be hard. We are excited to take on that challenge.
