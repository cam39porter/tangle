## The Human Condition

We humans forget, are lazy, and lose more information than we retain. This is not helped by the attention economy, which inundates us with stuff. All kinds of stuff. 

As consumers, we must *pay* attention, attention being a scarce resource, to all sorts of different content - both online and off. The more information we consume, the more it seems we lose. Surely there is a way to keep more of this information, turning it into knowledge rather than waste.

## Enter Knowledge Management Systems

Drum roll...

*oohs and ahs.*

Knowledge management systems, or KMS for short, are what we humans use to store our stuff. We take it from the internet and save it, or we write it up and save it. We save stuff constantly, both work-related and non-work related. 

KMS should make it super easy for us to do what the acronym stands for, manage knowledge, or keep track of the information that we have written or pulled from the internet and saved.

But KMS as we know it really stinks.

When saving personal documents, either you are one of the 1% jedi humans who maintain perfect naming convention discipline and folder structure. Or, you are like the other 99% of us that and just hit `command + s` and forget about it. 
 
At surface level, it would seem that this is not that big a deal...just spend a couple minutes searching your PC or Mac and you will most likely find the folder, file, and information you are looking for (I bet Google would have been easier, though). 

> What did I do with that file? Hmmm

Sound familiar? This happens all too often and is really just such a bore! Now, think about the KMS for massive companies that have hundreds or thousands of employees. 

Over time, thousands of folders have given birth to thousands of sub-folders - all pregnant with documents in all shapes, sizes and formats. 

Who is to say what goes where? Dave, who is my favorite generic cube hound, may have a different idea of where one file should be saved than say Janet. For example, the latest prospectus on the digital advertising market is saved down by Dave. He has plenty of options. 

Maybe the "adtech" folder.

Maybe the "market_research" folder.

Dave might be a desktop kind of guy. The KMS is Dave's oyster.

Dave also has a lof of different ideas on what to call the file. 

Propsectus-adtech-jan-2018

OR

Market-research-adtech-prospectus

It's been ten minutes already and Dave has finally decided on a naming convention and folder. Go Dave!

Both options make sense, but when searching a company database, the naming convention can make all the difference between watching the computer's wheels spin or finding your document when you need to.

## Knowledge Management IRL

Dave always makes me reflect on my own experiences. He is great at that. 

When I was an investment banking analyst, we had an absolutely massive amount of folders and files. It was my job to keep all these documents organized and retrieve the ones we needed whenever anyone asked. 

Yeah, fat chance.

There were sometimes hundreds of versions of the same document in a folder. Other times files that belonged one place had been mistakenly dropped in a folder that seemed related, but really wasn't. 

This particular issue was especially bad on one project I was given because the previous analyst who worked on it completely threw out any inkling of organization when he found out he got an offer at a private equity shop. The next few months of working at the bank now did not matter to this young man, and neither did proper KM etiquette. 

The project I am referring to had died for a while, but randomly resuscitated (as far too many zombie projects do) and I had to scramble to find the files my team needed. It took me so long that they asked me to reorganize the entire behemoth of that was the folder. It took me all night. 

I will never forgive you previous analyst!  

Files and folders do not work because there are inherent biases in any kind of shared curation. Imagine if instead of Google, it was Bank of America that supplied the search technology for consumers looking for retail banking products. That wouldn't work, would it?

Obviously not. The same kind of biases happen in file saving and curation. It is unfortunately too much for humans to handle and actually creates serious issues that can severely hurt the internal operations of a firm.
