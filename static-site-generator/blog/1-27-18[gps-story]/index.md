## October 7th, 1957

Great ideas, technologies and companies do not catalyze in a vacuum. They happen almost at random because of collaboration, sharing and cooperation among many parties. I think the story of how two scientists discovered GPS is one from which we can learn, and which we can emulate within our teams, organizations and companies to achieve valuable things/goals. 

The global positioning system, or GPS as we know it today, started off as a side-project. 

On October 7th, 1957, Will Guier and George Weiffenbach, two students at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (APL) were having lunch discussing the day’s most popular news: Sputnik’s launch into orbit three days prior. The two became rather excitable when they agreed it was likely that you could listen to Sputnik via the microwaves it was emanating. After discussing with classmates and professors, they quickly realized that nobody at APL had tried this yet.

It just so happened that Weiffenbach was in the middle of a Ph.D. on microwave spectroscopy and the 20MHz microwave he had in his office was the exact frequency needed to pick up the Sputnik’s signal. It turns out the Russians made Sputnik incredibly easy to listen to in order to prove that the whole thing was not a just a hoax. 

## A buzz on campus
Soon enough the entire APL had heard about the two’s discovery and passerby’s often stopped into Weiffenbach’s office to take a listen. Realizing that they were listening to history in the making, they rolled in an audio amplifier and began recording the signal as well - including timestamps whenever they recorded.

After doing this on a few separate occasions, Will and George realized that because Sputnik was emitting a signal at a steady frequency, and because the microwave receiver was stationary, they could calculate the movement of the satellite based on the changes in the waveform they were capturing. Later that night, they also remembered that by analyzing the slope of the Doppler shift, they could determine the point in Sputnik’s orbit that was closest to the APL laboratories. 

Almost by accident, they had hit upon a technique not just for calculating the satellite’s speed, but for actually mapping the trajectory of its orbit. In a matter of hours, the two young scientists had gone from listening to tracking the Russian satellite. 

As you can imagine, this discovery made the entire APL buzz, and soon enough a loose network of scientists and engineers coalesced around the two twenty somethings, offering insights, new approaches and technology improvements. APL then provided funding for Will and George to use the university’s new UNIVAC computer, and shortly thereafter, they successfully mapped the satellite’s entire orbit. 

## A call from the boss
About 6 months later, Frank McClure, the director of the APL, asked the two young men if they could flip the equation: If you could use the static position of the receiver and the doppler effect to map something in space. Could you then find the exact position of something on the ground knowing the exact orbit of a satellite in space?

To make a long story short, the answer is yes, you can. And, unbeknownst to them, Will and George had created the technology that would allow the US to track their nuclear submarines. 

Fast forward to today… the technology, now commonly known as GPS, has been made a public utility by Ronald Reagan. It is estimated that if GPS was shutoff, the economy would immediately lose ~$100bn.

This story is both remarkable and admirable, as well as offers us a unique lens through which to view raw innovation: a 60 year journey from listening to Sputnik, to ubiquitous GPS. 

## Questions to think about...
How can we implement themes from this story to spur innovation at every level in an enterprise?

Maybe more realistically, what are the kinds of tools companies need to catalyze the next GPS? 

How can we structure and instill organizations with the kind of culture that first led Will and George to explore an idea together, then coalesced a group of other scientists to bring the discovery from side-project to real breakthrough?

How do we make these interactions and repetitive and commonplace?
