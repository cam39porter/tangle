In our first [Problem Series](https://hex-ventures.github.io/hex-ventures/blog/problem-series-notes) post, we used Cameron-types and Myles-types as foils to discuss the three core issues with the state of note-taking today:

1. **Notes are siloed**

2. **Self-curation is not easy**

3. **Connecting the dots is work**

Today, you are going to read all about what we think about those pesky silos and how they trap your notes.

## Notes are here, there, and everywhere

We have done a lot of research and talked to a lot of people about what tools people use to jot down their thoughts. To avoid describing every single one, we have listed a few below in no particular order. I am sure you can relate to at least one!

1. Apple Notes
2. Reminder apps
3. Calendar reminders
4. Email-to-self
5. Note-taking apps
6. Google Docs
7. Microsoft Office Suite (PowerPoint and Word mainly)
8. Dedicated notebook
9. Stickies on laptop
10. Scribbles in the margin ([shoutout Da Vinci](https://hyperallergic.com/314053/leonardo-da-vincis-earliest-notes-on-friction-found-in-previously-overlooked-marginalia/))

I digress... The point is, people capture thoughts with a lot of different tools and more consequentially, in many different places.

## Linear thought silos

All these tools become what we call: linear thought silos.

> These silos keep your thoughts trapped.

We call them _thought_ silos because a note is simply that, a thought, captured as some form of data: text, image, audio, video etc. A thought alone is not particularly useful, but connected to other thoughts, can become a powerful network of ideas.

Silos are often _linear_ because they bias the most recent thoughts you capture based on recency. When you open Evernote for example, the most recent file in which you you took notes is at the top of your notebook folder. Of course, you are able to search some of these tools, but from my experience, search features are only average or poor.

## Connecting captures

The act of capturing thoughts is useful but connecting the dots between them is what allows for reflection, provides clarity, catalyzes ideation and helps people frame their thinking.

> Connecting your thought-captures when you go back through your writings provides immense value.

This becomes very difficult when you write down notes in linear silos.

**We are taking on the challenge of stopping thoughts from slipping through the cracks.**
