Cameron and I joke about opportunity cost a lot. 

Until recently Cameron has been splitting time between working on the product we are developing at Hex and his thesis – a pre-requisite to graduate from Princeton and something he put off while [kicking a ball around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwRHsmBB8s). Cameron's perceived opportunity cost of working on his thesis when he could be working on our product is astronomically high.

I disagree with him, however, and countered his feelings of frustrations with all the reasons why completing his thesis, and therefore graduating (read: in 7 years) had many more merits than he was giving credit. That conversation, though, is not the point of this post.

I joked with Cameron last week, bringing up his **lack** of focus on our venture when we went off on a tangent about the aforementioned opportunity cost. Our banter ended with us discussing our framework for outsourcing conveniences to third parties and helped us understand the birth the [convenience economy](https://www.salsify.com/blog/welcome-to-the-convenience-economy)  The highlights of this framework are below.

### Time's constant cost

In today's world, one can "do work" from anywhere. The office is now somewhat ubiquitous due to the proliferation of the laptop and cell phone. One can almost always create **value** for themselves, their company, or their clients as long as they have a connected device. 

Not only can we work anywhere, but we can work anytime as well. There really aren't many traditional nine-to-five jobs even offered anymore, especially if you are a knowledge worker. And, even if you usually do get home early, you can always earn extra money doing something else online or otherwise.

Now let's take a leap. If you can work anytime and anywhere, then there is necessarily a constant opportunity cost to your time. This opportunity cost can simply be thought of as your salary divided by some time period.

### In Practice

Using this rule, you can very quickly judge if it is beneficial to pay for a service (the convenience) or do it yourself:

If it takes you 15 minutes to walk to the dry cleaner, drop your clothes off, and walk back, then the opportunity cost of your commute is your hourly salary divided by four. It costs an extra 10 dollars for Boomerang to pick up your dry cleaning. If the opportunity cost is greater than 10 bucks, then buying the convenience makes economic sense.

You have the option of cooking and ordering in and the time difference from start to eating in both situations is for all intents and purposes the same. If the extra money you pay for ordering is less than the value of your time over that period, then it makes sense to pay for the convenience. 

While this framework is oversimplified and is not revolutionary, it can function as a reference point to help you make quick, rational decisions and mitigate wasting time pondering what to do in a given situation.
