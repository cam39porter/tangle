In [my last post](https://hex-ventures.github.io/hex-ventures/blog/gps-story), I recounted the story of how Will Guier and George Weiffenbach’s discussion at lunch turned into GPS technology. I ended the story by raising a series of questions regarding the opportunity for companies to use elements from this story in their own organization. Here they are along with actionable insights for taking these principles into your company or organization.


#### How can we implement themes from this story to spur innovation at every level in an enterprise?

Spontaneous collaboration can turn interesting ideas into tangible outcomes that bring value to your organization, clients and customers. There are a myriad of themes from Will and George’s story that can be translated into enterprise workflows - here are three that I found to be the most actionable:

1. Company as platform: The word “platform” gets thrown around a lot, but I truly believe that companies ought to design themselves as launching pads - platforms from which employees can initiate ideas, take risks, support others, fall down, get back up and ultimately, succeed. Will and George used the APL as their own launching pad to bring a an idea from side-project to technological breakthrough.

2. Connect, not protect: I have written previously about how companies can use Lisa Gansky’s concept of [mesh](https://hex-ventures.github.io/hex-ventures/blog/connection-trumps-protection) as a principle around which they organize. Creating a robust support network at a company is vital to positive idea generation and smart risk-taking. WIll and George certainly would not have achieved what they did without the help of other smart scientists, engineers, students and teachers that were working at the APL as well.

3. Investing in your people: time is money and money is time. Investing both in your employees and tools to help them achieve their goals will help a company achieve its own goals.  

#### Investing in your people is great, but what are the kinds of tools companies actually need to help them catalyze the next big idea? 

There is not one tool that will take your company to the next level, but we think that tools that help inspire collaboration,not just through messaging, but that pulls individuals to meet and collaborate face-to-face are helpful for letting ideas bounce off and stick to each other. 

#### How can we structure and instill organizations with the kind of culture that led Will and George to explore an idea together - and how do you make it repetitive? 

There is no objective formula for creating a corporate culture that breeds great ideas, but one constant is empowering the individual to **fail**. Empowering failure is the first step to success. From my own personal experience and anecdotal evidence from peers - all too often people are scared to fail. Humans are preconditioned to be fearful of embarrassment, but enterprises should instill practices that view failure as part of the process. 

#### How do we make interactions like the one George and Will had in the cafeteria repetitive and commonplace?

Tools and internal practices that spur collaboration, empower failure, and create an environment in which ideas are constantly generated and bounce off each other will inevitably lead to valuable innovation. One tried and true method for making positive interactions that lead to actionable outcomes commonplace is to design your workplace to be like the APL cafeteria - a space in which a diversity of ideas and insights can constructively collide, bounce off and stick to one another. 

Much has been written about how the design of a space can help foster an environment in which great ideas are formed. Homebrew Computing Club, Freud’s Wednesday salon and English coffeehouses during the industrial revolution are just a few of these. Perhaps doing away with the high-walled cubicles in favor of open space that invites rather than dissuades collaboration.

Lastly, company culture is ultimatley derived from the how the people in charge interact with others in the organization. Setting a standard of open communication, support and encouragement will make it easier for valuable ideas to come alive and become actionable.
